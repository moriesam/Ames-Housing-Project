    "As of now **`84%`** of variance in the sale price can be explained by this model, indicating that the model is just right. In other words,  model can generalize from train/test data to predict the house value, with **`+/-$29K`** price error. This model is built using numeric datasets, and can be improved by leveraging feature engineerign to include few key features like Neighborhood  by leveraincluding some key features like Neighborgood, style and materials. Nevertheless, this model can be used for the following purposes:<br>\n",
